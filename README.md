# Koulu

Open source classroom management web app primarily designed for High School

## How to run Koulu?
* Start MySQL / MariaDB (user and password must be `root`)
* Create a DB called `koulu`
* Run `npm install` on Koulu's directory to install dependencies
* Run Koulu with `node index.js`

## Troubleshooting
If `node index.js` fails, stop the app with `CTRL + C` and run `node index.js` again. The creation of the DB can fail the first time.

## Improving Koulu
Feel free to submit issues or pull request!
