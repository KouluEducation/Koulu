# Koulu
Open source classroom management web app primarily designed for High School.

For the time being, Koulu is being developed in Spanish. If you want to use Koulu in other language feel free to contribute adding more languages or submit an issue.

## How to run Koulu?
* Start MySQL / MariaDB (user and password must be `root`)
* Create a DB called `koulu`
* Run `npm install` on Koulu's directory to install dependencies
* Run Koulu with `node index.js`

## Troubleshooting
If `node index.js` fails, stop the app with `CTRL + C` and run `node index.js` again. The creation of the DB can fail the first time.

## Improving Koulu
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests :smiley:
